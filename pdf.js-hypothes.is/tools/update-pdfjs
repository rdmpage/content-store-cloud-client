# See https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-pdf.js-in-a-website#from-examples
#
# To update PDF.js to the latest version:
#
# 1. Create a new branch and run this script. This will fetch the latest PDF.js
#    release and commit the changes.
# 2. Check that PDF annotation works as expected. See the project README for
#    steps to run this locally.

# PDF.js comes in two flavors, one for modern browsers and one for older browsers,
# known as the "legacy" build.
#
# The versions supported by the legacy build are listed at
# https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#which-browsers-are-supported
# and as of September 2021 these align closely with what the client supports
# (see https://github.com/hypothesis/client/issues/3744).
#
# In the extracted tarball, the modern version is in pdf.js-gh-pages/ and the
# legacy version is in pdf.js-gh-pages/legacy/.
